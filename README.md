# RepoDoctor
RepoDoctor is an agentic code review tool. You paste a GitHub repo, and it gives you a senior-level Top 5 review with evidence and fixes. But the key difference is action — with one click, RepoDoctor turns those findings into real GitHub issues, so teams can immediately improve code quality.
